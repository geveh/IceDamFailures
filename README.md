# Code for *"Less extreme and earlier outbursts of ice-dammed lakes since 1900"*

## Overview

**This repository contains six scripts to estimate trends in the volume (*V*<sub>0</sub>), peak discharge (*Q*<sub>p</sub>), timing (day of year *doy*), and source elevation (*Z*) of ice-dam failures on regional and local (i.e. lake-) level. In addition, we investigate the consequences of melting glacier dams on the magnitudes of GLOFs.**

- [02_trends_in_Qp_and_V0.R](#02_trends_in_qp_and_v0r)
- [03_trends_in_doy.R](#03_trends_in_doyr)
- [04_glacier_volumes_and_ice_loss.R](#04_glacier_volumes_and_ice_lossr)
- [05_trends_in_Z.R](#05_trends_in_zr)
- [06_magnitudes_vs_elev_change.R](#06_magnitudes_vs_elev_changer)
- [summary_stats_veh_revision.py](#summary_stats_veh_revisionpy)

The codes are written in the statistical programming language **R** (https://www.r-project.org/), Version 4.2.0, and called within
the Graphical User Interface **RStudio** (https://rstudio.com) under a Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. 
Please install both **R and RStudio** on your machine to successfully run the codes and produce figures and R data objects.

The R codes depend on a number of packages, listed at the beginning of all scripts. Please install those packages before running the scripts. 
The comments within the scripts provide further details on model dependencies and usage of functions. 

Each script will call one or more input data object(s), which are available via ***Zenodo***.  
We also use freely available digital elevation models (DEMs), glaciological data (glacier outlines, estimates of ice thickness and mass loss), and lake outlines. Please download the data from the web sources provided in the scripts.  
Please put all input files into the same folder, and change the folder used in the script to your folder structure. The scripts can be executed one after the other, with the user generating output that is used as input for the next script.
The scripts (and parts thereof) can also be run independent of each other using the input files (in most cases *.RDS* files) from Zenodo.
Each script will produce output in form of a figure (displayed in the associate manuscript and Extended Data figures) or R-objects.
